      <p>I'm a software artisan (Engineer, developer, whatever you wanna call it; just never a ninja, rockstar or wizard... ðŸ˜…) from Mexico who is currently and happily employed to work on the Front End side of things for web apps.</p>

      <p>I'm also always trying to build or create something to scratch an own itch, and that is also aimed at sharing with others what I've learned in the process.</p>

      <p>This is why I have a YouTube channel, a Vue.js notes website and the ocassional blog post.</p>

      <p>Feel free to reach out and thanks a lot for checking out the content in advance, I sure hope it will help you one way or another.</p>

      <p>Cheers!</p>
