    <h2>Notes on Vue</h2>

    <p>I am in the path of becoming an instructor of sorts. I like sharing my knowledge and learning new things, but I also like eating and providing to my family the best life I can give them. So the idea for this website is two folded:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I want to organize my ideas and prepare some material I can use to be able to impart courses on Vue. At the same time other people can see what my understanding of the technology is.</li>

      <li>I wanted to learn VuePress and see what it was all about. So that eventually I could also share my findings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a continuos Work In Progress and I plan on finishing it sooner rather than later. Maybe by the first couple months within 2021 I will be done with it. ðŸ¤ž</p>
