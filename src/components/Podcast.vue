    <h2>Podcast</h2>

    <p>A good friend and I recently started working on a podcast for Spanish speaking developers.</p>

    <p>We are aiming it at being Web Development related, but it might have a couple other topics in there</p>

    <p>If you speak Spanish, or want to learn and practice I encourage you to give us a listen! 😁</p>
