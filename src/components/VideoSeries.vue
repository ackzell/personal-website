    <h2>&lt;video&gt; series</h2>

    <p>The idea behind the videos on YouTube is to present a series each time I work on something. From desktop apps, to in-browser voice recording ones and documentation sites.</p>

    <p>Video content can be tricky to follow: scrubbing the video in search for what you want or need can be time consuming. So my main idea is to share with you via small videos how these apps are created piece by piece. This way you can hopefully find what you need in the shorter pieces.</p>

    <p>I try to go straight to the point and trust you will be able to figure out whatever you need for the extra information regarding the different topics.</p>
